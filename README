This is 'lntree', a tool to compare directory trees.

'lntree old-dir new-dir' recursively examines all files in the two
source trees and link the files that are equal. To be precise: if two
files are equal (same size, same contents), the one in directory
new-dir is replaced by a link to the file in old-dir.

This results in cleaner source trees, and a substantial saving of disk
space, for example when multiple versions of the same source tree need
to be kept on-line.

To install, unpack the kit, change to the kit directory, and execute

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

Note that the last command usually requires root privilege.
